Windows Maintenance Tool is an all-in-one GUI toolkit for repairing, cleaning, updating, and tuning Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems. It brings common maintenance tasks into one interface instead of spreading them across Settings, Control Panel, PowerShell, Task Scheduler, Registry Editor, and separate utilities.

It is built for technicians, power users, and end users who want practical Windows maintenance tools with clear buttons, visible output, confirmation prompts, and local backups where risky changes are involved.

## Getting Started

### Recommended Launch

Double-click:

```bat
Start_WMT_GUI.bat
```

Keep `Start_WMT_GUI.bat` and `WMT-GUI.ps1` in the same folder. The launcher validates the script and starts the GUI with the required permissions.

### EXE Build

To build a local EXE release:

```powershell
.\PS2EXE\Build-Exe.ps1 -InstallPS2EXE
```

The default output is:

```text
dist\WindowsMaintenanceTool.exe
```

The EXE build uses the version from `$AppVersion` in `WMT-GUI.ps1` and requires administrator privileges at runtime.

### Manual Launch

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "WMT-GUI.ps1"
```

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Administrator privileges
- Internet connection for update checks, package scans, downloads, and online sources

## Output and Data Folder

WMT stores generated files in a local `data` folder next to the script.

| Output | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `settings.json` | Saved WMT settings |
| `Installed_Drivers.txt` | Driver report |
| `Drivers_Backup_*` | Exported driver backups |
| `SystemReports_*` | System, network, and driver reports |
| `RegistryBackups` | Registry cleanup backups |
| `hosts_backups` | Hosts file backups |
| `winapp2.ini` / cache files | Advanced cleanup community rules |
| `legendary` / `gogdl` | Local game-provider helper tools and auth files |
| Provider/library cache files | Cached PyPI and game-library metadata |
| `last-crash.txt` | Last captured WMT crash/monitor diagnostic |

## Safety Notes

- Destructive actions use confirmation prompts.
- Registry and hosts changes create backups where applicable.
- Many tweak groups include revert actions.
- Startup and service changes are visible in Startup Manager.
- Start with Windows repairs its saved launch path when WMT has been moved.
- Registry cleaner review-only rows are shown for inspection and are not fixed automatically.
- Tray/headless package automation is experimental and may still require manual provider interaction.
- WMT itself does not send telemetry.
- Some features use online sources, package managers, or Microsoft/Windows components.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to Try |
| --- | --- |
| The app does not start | Run `Start_WMT_GUI.bat` from the same folder as `WMT-GUI.ps1`. |
| SmartScreen blocks launch | Choose **More info** and **Run anyway** if you trust your local copy. |
| Admin prompt appears | Accept it. Most maintenance actions require elevation. |
| Winget scan fails | Make sure App Installer / Winget is installed and internet is available. |
| Package update hangs | Retry the individual provider or update the package manually. |
| Background/headless update does not finish | Disable headless mode and run the provider visibly from the Updates tab. |
| A game is missing from Game Library | Refresh the library and verify its launcher, local manifest, authentication, and provider toggles. |
| Start with Windows no longer works after moving WMT | Open Support & Credits; WMT can validate and repair its startup entry. |
| A tweak causes issues | Use the matching revert button where available. |
| Registry cleanup finds protected entries | Review-only entries are intentionally not fixed automatically. Inspect them before taking action. |
